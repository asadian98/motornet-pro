= Motivation
\
What's the big problem(s) we want to investigate, understand, in the future and why
#pagebreak()

= Vision
How we envision this project
We want to do stochastic model-based RL for reach control of a realistic arm \\
- What is reach control?
- Why stochastic?
- What is MotorNet?
- What is realistic arm?
#pagebreak()

= MotorNet
- The "MotorNet" in "MotorNet-Probabilistic"
- hola
#pagebreak()

= Realistic Arm Model
#pagebreak()

= Control Algorithm Basics
- Optimal feedback control
- Internal models
- Feedforward and feedback control
- ...

= SAC
- baseline model-free algorithm for our application
- complexities: choice of Q-network

= Preliminary Results
Show something/demo
